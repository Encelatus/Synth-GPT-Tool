Foreword  For the European grocery sector, 2022 was all about inflation and growing consumer price sensitivity. This led to the biggest decrease in the margins of grocers in five years. In real values, turnover dropped by 71 percent, driven by intensified downtrading across income brackets. While margins are decreasing, interest rates and capital costs are rising. As a result, many grocery retailers see the challenge is financing the investments both in sustainability and technology that are necessary to reduce emissions, build resilience, and drive future growth.  This year's report takes a comprehensive look at the key trends shaping the grocery industry in the coming years. How will the fact that consumers plan to save more money on food affect different formats, channels, and categories? Will grocery retailers need to look for further economies of scale to better deal with rising costs and increased margin pressure? To what extent are grocers equipped and resolved to leverage analytics and automation to drive productivity? As e-grocery largely retains the uplift observed during the pandemic and meal delivery grows, will more online offerings reach break-even in 2023? Finally, will more grocers join the ranks of the pioneers who already engage their suppliers to reduce greenhouse-gas emissions that occur during food production?  The State of Grocery report is an annual global publication covering three continents, with dedicated reports for Asia, Europe, and North America. This year's report, “Living with and responding to uncertainty – The State of Grocery Retail 2023: Europe,” is a continuation of a partnership between McKinsey & Company and EuroCommerce, designed to provide executives with a comprehensive view of the market and future trends. In preparing the report, we surveyed more than 12,000 consumers across eleven European countries and almost 50 grocery executives from more than 20 countries across Europe. In addition, we interviewed three industry thought leaders and pioneers. We combined EuroCommerce's policy and sector knowledge with McKinsey's global expertise and analytical rigor.  We hope this report will offer new insights and perspectives that will help grocers navigate a time of considerable uncertainty and set their companies up for future growth.

The image is a report page titled "Living with and responding to uncertainty – State of Grocery Retail 2023: Europe" by McKinsey & Company in collaboration with EuroCommerce and Europanel. The page number is 8.  The main heading is "Did anyone say inflation?" The text discusses the impact of inflation on consumer behavior and the retail sector in Europe throughout 2022. General inflation in the European Union increased from 2.9 percent in 2021 to 9.2 percent in 2022, reaching a peak of 11.5 percent in October. Food inflation was even higher, with some countries experiencing as much as twice the general inflation rate. This has put significant pressure on household economies, where expenses increased much faster than disposable incomes, leading to consumer downtrading to private labels and lower-cost options.  Overall grocery sales in Europe grew by 2.9 percent in 2022 over 2021, driven by higher prices, a decrease of 3.6 percent in volume sold, and a downtrading effect of 3.6 percent (Exhibit 1). There were significant variations among countries' levels, with more details in the "Food and grocery market KPIs," found on pages 36-37 of the report.  A quote from Luis Araujo, CEO of Biedronka, states: "In 2022, we were dealing with soaring inflation and an overall disruption of the supply chain in Poland, as well as with the impact of the war in Ukraine, our biggest neighbor country."  Exhibit 1 is titled "European grocery retail market dynamics were characterized by high inflation, volume decline, and trading down."  The exhibit includes a bar graph named "Growth of grocery retail 2022 vs previous year in 5 largest markets, %," which presents data on growth in Q1, Q2, Q3, Q4, and Total 2022 across three different metrics: Drivers, Volume, and Up- and downtrading. The figures in percent are as follows:  - Drivers: Q1: 4.5, Q2: 8.3, Q3: 7.1, Q4: 7.7, Total 2022: 3.0 - Volume: Q1: -2.0, Q2: -3.1, Q3: -3.8, Q4: -4.2, Total 2022: -3.4 - Up- and downtrading: Q1: -5.6, Q2: -4.3, Q3: -1.0, Q4: -2.9, Total 2022: -3.6 - Food inflation is shown in pink and it is consistent across all quarters at 2.9.  Additionally, the exhibit presents a line graph named "Development vs 2019, Indexed Q1 2019 = 100." This graph compares Market size and Volume for different quarters compared to Q1 2019, with Q1 2019 index set at 100:  - Market size is as follows: Q1: 111.4, Q2: 111.6, Q3: 115.0, Q4: 115.6, Q1 2023: 113.4. - Volume is as follows: Q1: 105.0, Q2: 102.7, Q3: 102.5, Q4: 101.8, Q1 2023: 102.3.  The notes under the graphs indicate that the figures may not sum up due to rounding, and the term "Europe" encompasses various countries that include Belgium, Czech Republic, France, Germany, Italy, Netherlands, Poland, Portugal, Spain, Sweden, and the United Kingdom. The source for volume and up- and downtrading data is Eurostat (inflation). The footnotes also clarify that "disposable income" is based on Oxford Economics data, and the countries included in the term "Europe" are Belgium, Czech Republic, France, Germany, Italy, Netherlands, Poland, Portugal, Spain, Sweden, and the United Kingdom. The data on Europanel is based on Belgium data.

Page 9  Discounters gained 14 percent in market share in Europe relative to 2021. This was largely driven by a combination of aggressive footprint growth in recent years, recovery from the pandemic-related sales dip, price inflation faster than market average and an increase in price sensitivity in the market. Discounters grew at the expense of all other channels; traditional trade declined by 0.3 percentage points, hypermarkets by 0.2, online by 0.8, and supermarkets by 0.1. Online penetration mostly stagnated in 2022, except for the United Kingdom and Sweden, where it declined by about one percentage point.^4  Because of cost inflation, lower volumes, and more price-sensitive customers, the margins of many European grocery retailers came under substantial pressure. Between 2019 and 2022, the average margin of European grocers decreased by three percentage points, our analysis shows. The EBITDA margin decreased by one percentage point, while the EBIT margin stagnated.  2023: Are we out of the woods? Consumer confidence is returning as inflation eases, although it is still below prepandemic levels. According to most forecasts, inflation in Europe will continue to abate over the course of 2023. Consumer confidence in the EU has been rising for five consecutive months; the level measured in February 2023 (+20.6, compared with -29.8 in September 2022) was the highest since the beginning of the war in Ukraine. That said, consumer confidence is still lower than it was in January 2022, before the war in Ukraine (-10.9) and much lower than it was in January 2019, before the pandemic (-5.9).  Grocery CEOs also remain cautious. According to our survey of 47 European grocery CEOs, 44 percent expect 2023 to be worse than 2022, and 33 percent think it will be as challenging as 2022. Only 23 percent believe 2023 will bring an improvement in market conditions (Exhibit 2). Respondents agree that the key themes for 2023 are rising costs and margin pressure, downtrading, and an increased focus on private labels.  Drawing on our consumer research (Exhibit 3), CEO survey (Exhibit 4), and market analysis, we identified eight trends (Exhibit 5) that we believe will shape the grocery landscape in 2023 and beyond. Some of these themes represent an acceleration of trends we outlined in last year’s report, while others are new and will likely prompt grocery executives to reassess and adapt their existing strategies.  4 See "Food and grocery market KPIs," pg. 36-7.

Exhibit 2  European CEOs are less pessimistic about market conditions in 2023 compared with last year.  European CEO survey results, sentiment toward 2023 grocery market conditions^1 (n = 47)  - 23% Become better   6 p.p. vs 2022 - 33% Remain the same   10 p.p. vs 2022 - 44% Become worse   -16 p.p. vs 2022  Words describing the grocery industry in 2023^2: - Challenging/Difficult - Price/Competitive - Changing/Uncertain - Post COVID/Recovering - Inflation - Cost Resilient - Supply chain  Footnotes: ^1 Question: "Thinking ahead, how do you see the market conditions for the grocery retail industry evolve in 2023?" ^2 Question: "Please choose the top 3 adjectives you would use to describe the grocery retail industry in 2022."  Source: McKinsey CEO Survey 2023 (n = 47); McKinsey CEO Survey 2022 (n = 57)  The page is numbered 10 and comes from a report titled "Living with and responding to uncertainty - State of Grocery Retail 2023: Europe." The image is credited to McKinsey & Company, EuroCommerce, and europanel.  Analytical Data Summary: - The survey indicates a slight shift towards a less pessimistic view amongst European CEOs regarding the grocery market conditions for 2023 compared to 2022. - A proportion of 23% of CEOs believe the market conditions will become better, which reflects a 6 percentage point increase compared to 2022 sentiments. - 33% of CEOs think the conditions will remain the same, showing a considerable 10 percentage point increase over last year's results. - Notably, there is a reduction in the number of CEOs who think the market conditions will worsen, down to 44%, which is a 16 percentage point decrease from 2022. - The words chosen by CEOs to describe the grocery industry in 2023 highlight the ongoing challenges and the dynamic nature of the market, with adjectives like "Challenging/Difficult," "Price/Competitive," "Changing/Uncertain," "Post COVID/Recovering," "Inflation," "Cost Resilient," and "Supply chain." These suggest that even though there's a less pessimistic outlook, the industry is still perceived as facing significant challenges and uncertainties.

This is Exhibit 3 from a report titled "Living with and responding to uncertainty – State of Grocery Retail 2023: Europe" prepared by McKinsey & Company in collaboration with EuroCommerce and Europanel.  The exhibit shows how consumers in various European countries are actively looking for more ways to save money across all surveyed countries, indicated through the net intent of consumers toward grocery shopping in 2023 compared with 2022.  Here is the numerical data presented in the exhibit:  Net intent of consumers toward grocery shopping in 2023 compared with 2022: - European average: +32% - Germany: +55% - United Kingdom: +55% - Netherlands: +53% - France: +56% - Belgium: +61% - Sweden: +57% - Italy: +58% - Denmark: +43% - Spain: +52% - Poland: +53% - Switzerland: +58%  The delta net intent from 2022 is also shown on a scale from 0 to +40.  Further behaviors and preferences accompanied by percentage changes for each country are listed as follows:  Consumers increasingly prioritize price: - European average: 53% - Germany: +4% - United Kingdom: 55% - Netherlands: +13%  - France: +13% - Belgium: N/A - Sweden: +22% - Italy: +10% - Denmark: +7% - Spain: 58% - Poland: +8%  Switch to less expensive foods to save money: - European average: 39% - Germany: +46% - United Kingdom: +43% - Netherlands: +43% - France: 37% - Belgium: 39% - Sweden: +43% - Italy: 37% - Denmark: +36% - Spain: 30% - Poland: +38%  Actively search for best promotions on food: - European average: +22% - Germany: +38% - United Kingdom: +24% - Netherlands: +41% - France: +19% - Belgium: N/A - Sweden: +36% - Italy: +14% - Denmark: +39% - Spain: +19% - Poland: +18%  Buy stores' own food brands instead of known brands: - European average: 36% - Germany: +47% - United Kingdom: +42% - Netherlands: +46% - France: 36% - Belgium: +37% - Sweden: 30% - Italy: 34% - Denmark: +18% - Spain: +35% - Poland: +26%  Buy high-quality/premium food products: - European average: -5% - Germany: -21% - United Kingdom: -12% - Netherlands: -9% - France: 4% - Belgium: -10% - Sweden: -5% - Italy: 17% - Denmark: -4% - Spain: 21% - Poland: -10%  Focus on healthy eating and nutrition: - European average: 3% - Germany: 25% - United Kingdom: 20% - Netherlands: 32% - France: 33% - Belgium: N/A - Sweden: 25% - Italy: 41% - Denmark: 39% - Spain: 22% - Poland: 16%  Pay a higher price to get a healthier product: - European average: -2% - Germany: -12% - United Kingdom: -7% - Netherlands: -1% - France: 2% - Belgium: N/A - Sweden: -1% - Italy: -3% - Denmark: -1% - Spain: -7% - Poland: -3%  Buy organic/natural products: - European average: 3% - Germany: N/A - United Kingdom: 14% - Netherlands: -6% - France: 2% - Belgium: N/A - Sweden: 9% - Italy: 7% - Denmark: N/A - Spain: 14% - Poland: -3%  Buy environmentally friendly products (e.g., reusable bags, made of recycled materials, minimum packaging): - European average: 17% - Germany: 25% - United Kingdom: N/A - Netherlands: N/A - France: 27% - Belgium: N/A - Sweden: 13% - Italy: 25% - Denmark: N/A - Spain: 16% - Poland: N/A  For online attitudes, the data states: - Online attitudes are stable - Buy groceries online: European average 0%, Germany +1%, United Kingdom +4%, Netherlands +3%, France -4%, Belgium -4%, Sweden N/A, Italy -3%, Denmark +7%, Spain +2%, Poland +3%.  Additional notes on the image indicate that "Share of consumers who want to do more of activity minus share of consumers who want to do less of activity in 2023 vs 2022," and comparison excludes Belgium and Denmark since they were not surveyed last year. Moreover, there is a note stating that "Net intent" is calculated as the share of total population who currently shop online (e.g., monthly) and will do more of it plus share of total population who currently don't shop online but will do more, etc.  This analytical overview shows a general trend among European consumers towards more cost-saving behaviors, with specific interest in price prioritization, switching to less expensive foods, active search for promotions, and purchasing stores' own brands over known brands. It also highlights a slight move toward healthy and environmentally friendly products, with online grocery shopping behaviors remaining relatively stable.

The survey sources are cited as McKinsey CEO Survey 2023 (n = 47) and McKinsey CEO Survey 2022 (n = 57). The logos of McKinsey & Company, EuroCommerce, and Europanel are displayed at the bottom right.  Analytical summary: - Margin pressure remains the most frequently mentioned top challenge by CEOs with no change in rank, reflecting ongoing concern in the industry. - The trend of "Differentiating with Private Labels" experienced the most significant rise in rank, indicating a growing focus on private label products. - "Scaling Online Grocery" and "Ensuring Future Talent" saw the largest decreases in rank, suggesting these areas might have become slightly less urgent or have seen progress in the past year. - The consistency in the areas of "Modernizing IT" and "Increased Investments" suggests that these might be considered ongoing strategic areas without drastic change in importance year over year.

Exhibit 5  Key trends There are eight trends that will characterize the European grocery retail market in 2023.  1. Gradual normalization of price and volume Retail prices take up to 12 months to follow commodity price evolution. Commodity prices peaked in Q3 2022, so volume decline should halt as prices normalize in H2 2023.  2. A focus on cheaper food through private labels and discounters 84% of respondents rate private labels similar to or higher in quality compared to branded products.  3. Continued margin and cost pressure 88% of surveyed European executives named margin pressure a top trend for 2023.  4. A race for economies of scale 53% of consumers look for ways to save money when shopping, up from 41% in 2022. This increases the need for economies of scale.  5. The quest for profitable online growth ~75% of UK customers shop online sometimes or always with a different banner than offline.  6. Retail media as a core profit center + €11 billion additional annual media spend will go into retail media by 2025.  7. Systematic scaling of automation and technology 1+ p.p. total EBIT margin improvement potential of use-cases in automation, technology and advanced analytics, including Generative AI.  8. Supplier collaboration to solve for sustainability ~50% of value chain emissions of grocers are in the meat and dairy categories.

The image contains text and a bar chart titled "Exhibit 6: Volume expected to stay roughly stable in 2023 compared to Q4 last year." The content of the image is part of a page, numbered 14, from a report discussing retail volumes and inflation trends in Europe. Here is the analysis of the data and text present on the image:  Heading: Gradual normalization of price and volume - The first quarter of 2023 is expected to be the turning point after which retail volume stays relatively stable and inflation gradually normalizes.  Text Analysis: 1. In 2022, retail volumes declined across Europe by 3.6% compared with 2021. 2. Most of this drop in volume happened in the second quarter of 2022 due to effects associated with the COVID-19 pandemic. 3. Retail volumes stayed mostly stable in the other quarters of 2022.  Predictions for Future Volumes: 1. Retail volumes are expected to remain stable or slightly decline through 2023 versus the fourth quarter of 2022 levels. 2. The first quarter of 2022 saw the lowest volumes and starting from the second quarter of 2023, volume development is expected to be flat or slightly negative relative to 2022. 3. This would result in a volume decline of 1 to 2 percent for the full year compared with the previous year (Exhibit 6).  Inflation Analysis: 1. While general inflation declined at the start of 2023, food inflation was still rising. 2. Food commodity prices have passed their peak and decreased significantly in the first quarter of 2023. 3. The global agriculture price index was 12.8 percent below its April 2022 peak. 4. Household energy prices decreased by 8.3 percent in February 2023 compared with January 2023.  Bar Chart Analysis (Exhibit 6): - The bar chart depicts quarterly development in retail volume for the year 2022 and forecasts for the full year 2023 for five large markets, including France, Germany, Italy, Spain, and the United Kingdom.  Bar Chart Data: - Q1 2022: 2.7 - Q2 2022: 2.5 - Q3 2022: 1.8 - Q4 2022: 1.3-1.8 (forecasted) - FY 2023F: 1.3-1.8 (forecasted)  Interpretation of Bar Chart: - There was a slight decrease in retail volume across the quarters of 2022. - The forecast for the full year 2023 suggests that the volumes would be roughly the same as the estimated volume in the last quarter of 2022, indicating a stabilization in retail volumes.

The image contains a section of a report titled "2 A focus on cheaper food through private labels and discounters." The main points from the textual content are:  - Saving money on food remains a top priority for both high- and low-income consumers in 2023. - All income groups were trading down in 2022, with a reduction in the difference between income groups in terms of how much they were saving on food. - At the beginning of 2022, a consumer survey showed that people wanted to save money on food, predominantly in low-income households. - The share of private labels increased across Europe by 1.9 percentage points on average, and the market share of discounters increased by 1.4 percentage points. - In 2023, consumers plan to trade down further, with 53 percent wanting to save more money on food and 36 percent wanting to buy more private labels than they did in 2022. Consumers also plan to spend less on premium, healthy, and sustainable products to make ends meet. - Health eating remains a key concern, with 24 to 37 percent of consumers intending to focus on healthy eating in 2023.  The report also includes a graphical data representation titled "Exhibit 7," which is "Low- and high-income groups experience similar trends, but at different rates." It compares attitude toward grocery shopping in 2023 with 2022, and the key insights are:  - Attitude toward price: Low-income consumers show a +2 percentage point (p.p.) change toward looking for more ways to save money (from 52% in 2022 to 55% in 2023), while high-income consumers show a +18 p.p. change (from 32% in 2022 to 50% in 2023).    - Attitude toward quality: Low-income consumers show a -9 p.p. change toward buying high-quality/premium food products (from 20% in 2022 to 11% in 2023), and high-income consumers show a -16 p.p. change (from 20% in 2022 to 4% in 2023).  - Attitude toward health: Low-income consumers show a -5 p.p. change toward focusing more on healthy eating and nutrition (from 29% in 2022 to 24% in 2023), while high-income consumers show a -2 p.p. change (from 39% in 2022 to 37% in 2023).  The quote from Nina Jonsson, ICA Gruppen, states: "Once consumers try a private label product, they are often pleasantly surprised by the product quality, and some of them stick with them."  The source of the data is the McKinsey Consumer Survey 2023, in a sample of 12,776 in Belgium, Denmark, France, Germany, Italy, Netherlands, Poland, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland, and the United Kingdom with a general population of 18+ years of age. This information appears as a footnote and was collected among respondents intending to do activity 'Think more about X' or 'Are planning to do more, less, or about the same as the following.' The data represents net intent (%) of people planning to do activity/activity minus % of people intending to do activity/less.

The image is a report page discussing continued margin and cost pressure, specifically focusing on the grocery sector. Here is the information extracted from the textual content and the graphical data:  **Continued margin and cost pressure** - The profitability of grocers was hit hard in 2022, with pressure on margins, cash flows, and the cost of capital likely to remain high in 2023. - Margins decreased for both grocery retailers and food processors (consumer-packaged-goods companies) between 2019 and 2022. - The EBITDA margins of grocery retailers decreased by 1.0 percentage point, while the EBITDA margins of food processors decreased by 0.8 points (Exhibit 8).  It is expected that cost and margin pressure for grocery retailers will remain high at least in the first half of 2023 due to issues such as salary growth and energy cost increases, which have not yet reached grocery retailers. A leading energy price forecast agency predicts that energy and many food producer prices peaked in the third quarter of 2022, but increases will take time to affect food processor prices and ultimately reach consumer prices set by grocery retailers. New regulations could further pressure margins.  Investments for grocery retailers are increasing, with an additional €70 billion required by 2030 for sustainability, digitalization, IT improvements, and automation—an increase of 25 to 50 percent relative to current levels. The cost of capital for grocery retailers is increasing, making it more expensive to borrow money or raise new capital.  **Margins performance:** - Comparing the margins between 2019 and 2022, for grocery retailers:   - Gross margin decreased by 2.5 percentage points from 27.0% to 24.5%.   - EBITDA margin decreased by 1.0 percentage point from 7.3% to 6.3%.   - EBIT margin remained the same at 3.0%.  For the top-7 CPG players:   - Gross margin decreased by 3.0 percentage points from 53.2% to 50.2%.   - EBITDA margin decreased by 0.8 percentage points from 23.0% to 22.2%.   - EBIT margin decreased by 0.5 percentage points from 19.1% to 18.6%.  In "Both retailers' and CPG companies' margins face substantial pressure," the report illustrates the margin performance changes in graphical form indicating the margin decreases for grocery retailers and top consumer packaged goods (CPG) players from 2019 to 2022.

Page 17  Title: 4 A race for economies of scale  Structural measures to achieve synergies and economies of scale are likely to intensify as smaller grocery retailers are disproportionately affected by current market developments.  The current environment has placed significant demands on grocery retailers to manage cost. Scale has long been a benefit in the market. For example, bringing large volumes to the table in negotiations with leading brands can lower the cost burden substantially. Similarly, investments in technology and sustainability are easier to absorb if they can be spread and leveraged across a larger network of stores. In a situation characterized by increasing price sensitivity, margin pressure, and substantial investment needs, the value of scale will further increase.  In 2023, we foresee an accelerating race for economies of scale. Larger players may pursue more intense M&A strategies or seek to form broader partnerships—strategies that have often proved valuable in times of turmoil. In contrast, smaller players are likely to explore alternative ways of achieving scale, such as through bundle purchasing, joining franchising networks, and forming partnerships for joint investments. Some indications of this trend were already apparent in the second half of 2022. For example, Rewe has announced that it will invest €5 billion by 2025 to expand its footprint in Europe through targeted investments and smaller acquisitions. Ahold Delhaize took on the Jan Linders chain as an Albert Heijn franchise. Aldi Nord announced that it will exit the Danish market, while Coop Denmark is merging formats to capture synergies. The Scandinavian purchasing group Coop is teaming up with the French retailer Carrefour to make French, Italian, and Spanish private-label products available in the Nordics.

The image contains a section of a report titled "5 The quest for profitable online growth." The main discussion is about the post-pandemic stagnation period and expectations for the growth of e-grocery and its profitability. The focus is on maintaining profitability while being pressured by pure players. It highlights that meal delivery will likely overtake e-grocery in market size.  The text includes a quote from Tomáš Čupr, Group CEO, Rohlik Group: "I believe online can be more profitable than offline, as long as you don't try to be all things to all people."  Key points from the text: - E-grocery penetration stagnated in 2022. - Growth is expected to return to long-term trends witnessed during the COVID-19 pandemic. - Consumers are considering both online and offline channels, with 75% of customers in the UK preferring either online exclusively or a mix of online and offline. - Rohlik Group has already reached profitability and suggests this is attainable despite a challenging investor environment.  Analytical Data (Exhibit 9) titled "The market is growing faster for meal delivery than for e-grocery":  - Market Size for E-Grocery and Meal Delivery:   - E-grocery:     - In 2019: €19 billion     - In 2022: €28 billion     - Compound Annual Growth Rate (CAGR) 2019-22: +15% per annum   - Meal Delivery:     - In 2019: €11 billion     - In 2022: €23 billion     - CAGR 2019-22: +26% per annum  - Online Penetration 2019-22 is shown by a green and purple flag:   - E-grocery is marked at 6%   - Meal delivery is marked at 13%  The analytical data suggests that the growth rate for meal delivery services is outpacing that of e-grocery, with a higher CAGR and a significant increase in market size from 2019 to 2022. This indicates a shift in consumer preference toward meal delivery services over e-grocery.

Exhibit 10  Title: Marketing managers report strong performance and anticipate further growth of retail media.  Key Points from the Graphical Representations: - 90% of advertisers expect the share of marketing budget allocated towards grocery retail media network (RMN) spend to grow in 2023. - 80% of advertisers say that RMNs are very to extremely important to their advertising/marketing efforts. - 70% of advertisers say that RMNs outperform other marketing channels/tactics.  Retail media as a core profit center  Textual Data: - Across Europe, top players are either launching or expanding their retail media businesses, which are likely to become a substantial EBIT driver for the grocery industry.    - The emergence of retail media (RM) as the third wave of digital advertising puts grocery players in a favorable position to provide targeted advertising opportunities and helps boost their profitability. RM is highly attractive to advertisers because it allows for much more granular targeting than other forms of advertising. In addition, it allows advertisers to measure the return on ad spending (ROAS) much more accurately at the product level by using the retailer's sales and website data. In the United States, RM sales make up to 10 percent of online food sales and yield EBIT margins exceeding 50 percent.  - While RM is not a new phenomenon, there is a lot of growth potential yet to be captured in Europe. In 2022, the European RM market was worth about €10 billion, less than one-quarter of the value of the US market. The European market is expected to grow to about €21 billion in 2025 according to a McKinsey survey.  - 90 percent of RM investments plans to increase their spending on RM in the next 12 months (Exhibit 10), compared with a cross-industry average of about 60 percent. This spending will mostly go to existing CGP spend allocated to grocers. To take advantage of this trend, 18 of the 30 largest European grocers have already launched or started to develop their RM businesses.  - Looking forward, RM is likely to become a must-have for European grocers. Leaders are already scaling up their ecosystems beyond the core offering. For example, Carrefour has entered a partnership with Publicis and Citrus Ads to monetize joint capabilities and provide an RM platform for smaller grocery retailers ("RM as a service"). Ahold Delhaize has declared that it will buy stakes in the adtech platform Adhese. Tesco and Sainsbury's have announced TV network deals to leverage their data for tailored TV advertising.  Analytical Insights: - Retail media in Europe is observed to be in an expansion phase with significant growth potential, notably with a projected market size increase from €10 billion in 2022 to €21 billion in 2025. - The interest in RM among advertisers is high, with 90% planning to increase their RM budget and 80% considering RM very important to their marketing efforts. - The data suggests a perception that RM is outperforming traditional marketing channels, as indicated by the sentiment of 70% of advertisers. - The strategic moves by large grocers such as Carrefour, Ahold Delhaize, Tesco, and Sainsbury’s to expand into RM and form partnerships or make investments in technology suggest a shift towards integrating RM more deeply into their business models.

Section Title: Systematic scaling of automation and technology  The image contains a page discussing the importance of scaling automation and technology, its impact on the grocery retail industry, the role of IT modernization, and the potential of generative AI (GenAI) in creating additional value.  Main Text Summary: Technology remains a crucial driver of value creation in the industry and will require an additional €40 billion in investment by 2030. Automation in warehouses and stores is expected to grow at an annual rate of 13 percent, reaching about €6 billion in 2030. Retailers are increasingly using automated picking and depalletizing, and IT modernization is key. However, IT upgrades strain budgets and may require replacing older systems. Advanced analytics and GenAI are part of the industry's DNA, and there is potential to use these technologies to create more customer personalization and efficient operations.  Exhibit 11 Description: Generative AI creates additional value potential for retailers, with a focus on marketing and support functions.  The exhibit shows the expected value of analytics and on-top potential from GenAI as a percentage of total EBIT impact from analytics and GenAI for different retail functions. The data is presented in a bar chart with the following figures:  - Category management: 45-50% - Supply chain management: 15-20% - Store operations: 10-15% - Marketing: 10-15% - Support functions (customer service, HR, IT, finance): 5-10%  The exhibit includes examples of how GenAI can be utilized in these areas: - Provide smart conversational chatbots for next-gen shopping experiences and customer support. - Summarize or draft legal documents, job descriptions, interview questions. - Generate customized marketing materials. - Provide software engineers with coding support.

Page 21  Title: Supplier collaboration to solve for sustainability  The importance of sustainability continues to increase for grocers, despite the current dip in consumer demand. While the investments required to reduce Scope 1 and 2 emissions are substantial, the necessary actions are clear. In contrast, Scope 3 requires further understanding.  Investments in more energy-efficient freezers, for example, yield a positive net present value (NPV) and involve substantial capital expenditures that could total €25 billion to €65 billion by 2030 across the European grocery retail industry.  Scope 1 and 2 emissions make up only 7 percent of all emissions associated with retail, making it crucial to engage suppliers and consumers to reduce Scope 3 emissions, which represent half of all Scope 3 category emissions.  To move the needle on Scope 3, retailers are starting to establish joint initiatives with their suppliers. For example, Carrefour has engaged suppliers to commit to reducing their CO2 emissions by 20 megatons by 2030. Tesco has partnered with a bank to offer preferential borrowing rates to suppliers that disclose carbon data. Kesko has launched an app for their consumers that can monitor climate targets through shopping baskets.  DEFINITION: Scope 1 – direct emissions generated by an organization Scope 2 – emissions generated by production of purchased energy Scope 3 – indirect emissions from up and down the value chain  Exhibit 12 The equation for Scope 1 and 2 is directionally solved and accounts for a minor share of emissions, while Scope 3 remains a key issue.  Grocery retail GHG emission breakdown, % of CO₂e Total Scope 3 breakdown includes: - Meat: 34.0% - Dairy: 17.0% - Packaged food1: 13.2% - Dry food1: 10.5% - Beverages2: 8.0% - Others: 7.6% - Key focus area in the coming years: 2.1% for beverages, 2.7% for others  Footnotes indicate: 1 Processed meat, processed seafood and others (pizza, ready meals, soups, etc.) 2 Both alcoholic and soft beverages.

The bottom of the page shows logos for: - McKinsey & Company - EuroCommerce - Europanel  Analytical Summary: - Investments to reduce Scope 1 and 2 emissions are significant and their actions are well understood. - Scope 3 emissions are a major concern since they represent half of all Scope 3 category emissions and require broader engagement with suppliers and consumers. - The grocery retail GHG emissions are predominantly from Scope 3, with Meat constituting 34.0% and Dairy 17.0% of the total Scope 3 emissions, followed by packaged and dry food, and beverages. - Key focus areas in the coming years for grocery retail GHG emission reduction are beverages and others, which may include various non-food items or less commonly categorized food items. - Collaborative efforts and innovative solutions such as apps, preferential lending, and joint commitments to emission reduction targets are strategies being employed to address Scope 3 emissions.

Implications for grocers  The current environment is challenging, but it offers opportunities to grocers that act boldly. According to our research, companies that took decisive action during the global financial crisis of 2007-08 performed better throughout the crisis and experienced higher growth once the crisis was over than those that did not. On average, these outperformers reduced their costs more aggressively than competitors during the crisis, which gave them the capacity to invest in growth opportunities. They also displayed nonperforming parts of their business (for example, certain formats) more systematically than their peers. Once the crisis was winding down, these companies were among the first and the most determined to make investments and acquisitions in attractive growth segments. Looking ahead, we see three strategic priorities for grocery retailers that will help them emerge stronger from the current period of disruption and uncertainty.  Strengthening private-label assortments and capabilities  A stronger private-label capability will help retailers remain attractive while consumers are trading down and during the subsequent recovery period. Our experience shows that a broader and more attractive private-label offering in the lower-priced part of the assortment shows the highest correlation with market share gains in the current market environment.

The image presents a page from a report, which is page 23, with text discussing the topic of "Living with and responding to uncertainty - State of Grocery Retail 2023: Europe." Here's the extracted information:  Quote: "Digitalization is the most important megatrend. One aspect of that is e-commerce. Another crucial aspect of digitalization is data leverage. This applies both to consumer data and operational data. Advances in analytics, artificial intelligence, and automation will help make our business more efficient." —Luís Araujo, CEO, Biedronka  Text Content: Retailers might take inspiration from leading CPG companies in their private-label offerings design to win and premium part of their assortment. Concerning health, during the second half of the year, they should think about innovations and premium private-label design capability to differentiate the assortment offering.  Creating room for investments by acting boldly on profitability: To enhance margin and tackle cost, grocers should focus on data-driven supplier negotiations and precise pricing for grocery retailers via assessing the cost and value of each product. By addressing the entire supply chain, retailers can increase efficiency; for instance, reviewing underfooting stores or divesting channels that do not yield enough profit and do not support the company's strategic objectives. Grocery retailers should accelerate their online ventures' paths to break even, leveraging online supply chain automation and tapping into high-margin adjacency opportunities like retail media and meal delivery.  Investing in future growth: - Moving from analytics exploration to implementation by building capabilities for implementing them at scale. - Collaborating across the value chain to reduce emissions, with a focus on Scope 1 and 2 emission reduction and Scope 3 as an essential role. - Preparing for future e-grocery growth, expecting it to reach profitability within the next two to three years and at least double by 2030.

Interview  "Because of our size, what we do has an impact on the whole market, and we take that responsibility very seriously." Nina Jönsson President and CEO, ICA Gruppen AB PHOTO: ICA REKLAM  ICA is the leading Swedish grocery retail chain, with 1,560 grocery stores in Sweden, Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania.  Q: Over the past ten years, ICA has been among the most successful grocers in Europe. What are the key drivers of that success?  A: Our biggest asset is the entrepreneurship of our store owners. Originally, ICA was an association of individual store owners who came together to collaborate on things like purchasing, logistics, and marketing. ICA Gruppen was established only ten years ago, and to this day, anything that comes out of our central functions is thoroughly tested in a small number of stores and refined before we scale it up. Our store owners keep their ears close to the ground, and they make sure that we bring only the most promising new products or categories to the market. Additionally, they help us adjust our offering to whatever is required at the local level.  Another important success factor is our evolving ecosystem of adjacent businesses. Next to grocery stores, we also run Sweden's leading pharmacy chain and a bank that has grown out of our customer card. Everything we do revolves around everyday consumption.  Q: What are your expectations on how market conditions for the grocery retail industry will evolve in 2023? What could that mean for a player such as ICA?  A: I think market conditions will remain challenging throughout 2023. The disposable income of consumers has taken a major hit because of the rising cost of living and because salaries are not growing as fast as prices. So there is a lot of price pressure that will lead to further polarization in the sector. In the past, consumers often did all their shopping with us; now, many of them go to discounters, at least for basic items. But at the same time, many people are spending more money at restaurants. So I believe that convenience will still be an important factor in the future. Consumers will always look for ways to save time and make their lives easier, and that is what we offer.  Q: Do you see indications of customers trading down more?  A: Absolutely. For example, we saw a big increase in the share of private labels in the fourth quarter of 2022, and I believe it will continue. Once consumers try a private-label product, they are often pleasantly surprised by the product quality, and some of them stick with private label.

The image contains textual data from a report or interview discussing the current trends and strategies in the grocery retail sector. Here is the extracted information from the text, including the page number at the bottom:  Page Number: 26  Title: Living with and responding to uncertainty - State of Grocery Retail 2023: Europe  Interview Questions and Answers:  Q: Do you observe any changes in consumer attitude toward sustainability? And how are you driving your sustainability agenda at ICA?  A: Consumers are currently focused on saving money and are buying fewer sustainable products, with the share of ecological products at an all-time low of around 3 percent. However, this is considered a temporary dip. ICA is committed to sustainability and decarbonization efforts.  - ICA is reducing the packaging material of private-label products. - ICA aims to minimize transportation of goods over long distances. - ICA ensures local product availability and only selects Swedish meat from stores in Sweden. - ICA offers a variety of plant-based products to provide affordable sustainable options.  Q: What about meat alternatives? Is that a big topic for ICA?  A: Meat alternatives are a significant topic. ICA believes consumers will eat less meat in the future and works with smaller companies that focus on meat and dairy alternatives. There is a growing demand for innovative products in this area, and ICA is committed to developing products that are environmentally friendly and taste good. The variety of vegetable department used to comprise just a few products, but now has around 500 SKUs. Eating green is a key trend in markets, which ICA will continue to innovate and expand.  Q: Do you observe any variation in performance across different formats? How does ICA’s multiformat configuration and overall positioning shape your actions in the context of current trends?  A:  - ICA operates four different store types but plans to decrease the differentiation between formats. - All formats aim to communicate value for money, whether it is a supermarket or a hypermarket. - The best assortment is targeted for each store's catchment area. - The focus is on local environment customization within stores.  The main shift in the market is between channels that communicate exclusively online and the winners in the recent past. But not all consumers feel the same price pressure, and proximity is key.  Q: And what are your observations regarding e-grocery?  A: In Sweden, ICA's primary market, online share is about 3.5 percent of total sales. Most of this is click-and-collect.  Analytical Observations:  - Sustainability is a permanent feature in the retail strategy despite the temporary decline in consumer-driven sustainable choices. - ICA is engaging in multiple strategies to minimize environmental impact and offer sustainable products at affordable prices. - There is a constant effort to meet the growing trend for meat alternatives and green eating. - The company is recognizing the importance of a multiformat strategy and the need for local customization. - Proximity to customers and price competition remains critical, despite the rise of online-exclusive channels. - E-grocery has a small but significant portion of total sales, with a focus on click-and-collect services.

The image presents a page with text from an informal interview or discussion format, discussing the outlook and strategies of ICA, a grocery retailer. Below are the details from the text, including the questions (Q) and answers (A):  Q: How do you deal with margin pressure? A: ICA has a major productivity program to improve operations and reduce costs across the organization. To this end, ICA plans to increase the use of robots and leverage artificial intelligence (AI) to make operations more efficient. They focus on productivity to provide value and loyalty.  Despite expectations that input costs will decrease, they remain vigilant due to factors such as the ongoing war in Ukraine causing energy prices to remain high.  Q: What are the major opportunities for ICA going forward? A: The vast amount of traffic to their stores and website presents a huge opportunity. ICA is one of the most popular websites in Sweden and aims to engage customers searching for good pancake recipes or other ingredients. They are considering what other services they can offer to customers to increase their share of wallet.  ICA recognizes the potential in their customer card, which was very successful after the introduction of the best savings interest rate when banking interest rates were low. This led to millions transferred into these accounts within two weeks, which reflects in increased spending at ICA stores.  The quotation highlighted in the text is: "We will increase the number of robots we use and take advantage of AI to make our operations more efficient."  Q: Is there anything else you would like to share with your fellow grocers? A: There is a focus on the responsibility of the sector for being a major employment entry point and the importance of modeling values, creating a good environment, and providing opportunities for their employees.

The image is a page from a publication titled "Living with and responding to uncertainty - State of Grocery Retail 2023: Europe," with the page number 29 at the bottom. It features an interview with Tomáš Čupr, Group CEO of Rohlik Group, which is a leading European e-grocery retailer active in the Czech Republic, Hungary, Austria, Germany, and most recently also in Romania.  Key points from the interview are as follows:  Q: Rohlik is a fairly young company. Can you tell us the story of why and how you launched it? A: Tomáš Čupr's inspiration to start Rohlik was influenced by a McKinsey report from 2013 on the future of online grocery in Europe. This report outlined various barriers that were preventing people from buying groceries online, such as limited assortments and concerns about reliability, freshness, and speed. When he founded Rohlik in the Czech Republic one year later, in 2014, he aimed to address and overcome these barriers. Rohlik differentiated itself by offering same-day delivery, which was not common at the time. They went even further with their delivery window down to 90 minutes, and created an unprecedented proposition in the world of grocery e-commerce based on differentiation, reliability, and service. Their policy was customer-centric, offering a money-back guarantee if customers were not satisfied.  Q: What about profitability? A: Rohlik achieved profitability four years after its inception, in 2018, in the Czech Republic. Since then, the company has remained profitable, with a profit margin over five percent. The initial profitability in the Czech Republic encouraged the use of venture capital for geographical expansion, leading to launches in Hungary, Austria, Germany, and Romania. The company aims to be profitable across various markets and believes that online can be more profitable than offline due to its focus on affluent customers in urban areas, efficient inventory gains through artificial intelligence and machine learning, and precise order planning. Unlike brick-and-mortar players, Rohlik does not have a large array of item types. The company intends to leverage its structural differences to enhance profitability.  Q: Was COVID a major driver of growth for Rohlik in the past two years? A: The question is posed, but the answer to this question is not included in the provided text.  The page header reads "Interview" and features a quote from Tomáš Čupr saying, "The reason for our continued success is that we offer something that people don’t use out of necessity. They use it because they want to."

Page 30  Living with and responding to uncertainty - State of Grocery Retail 2023: Europe  Textual content from the image:  ---  Q: Did the scale of your business change with COVID-19?  A: Not really. We started scaling the business well before COVID. When the pandemic hit, we were already a €200 million business, with venture funding in the magnitude of €5 million. I admit that the lockdowns did accelerate our growth, but fundamentally, I believe that you don't need external events to scale if you have a good proposition. We were growing at a rate of 100 percent before COVID.  Q: Did and sales drop off when lockdowns were lifted?  A: No. We continue to grow at more than 40 percent, and it's mostly like for like, because we didn't really add cities. The reason for our continued success is that we offer something that people don't use out of necessity. They use it because they want to. As I said, COVID did bring some new customers, and a lot of them found that they liked this way of shopping, and they stayed with us.  Q: Now that the pandemic is over, a lot of consumers are struggling with the effects of inflation. Do you see indications of customers trading down more?  A: We don't see much of it. The affluent urban customers we target don't feel huge pressure on their wallets. They value our big assortment and the fast delivery we offer. And when people do trade down, we make sure they trade down with us. We make it very hard for them to leave us for another retailer.  Q: How do you do that?  A: Value for money is key. The price per SKU is constantly increasing, so some people are buying fewer SKUs. In effect, they feel that they get less for their money. To make sure these shoppers stay with us, we are pushing value for money.  Last year, we froze the prices of basic commodities like milk, rice, and potatoes, about 60 SKUs in total. In some cases, our customers got milk for half of what they would have had to pay elsewhere. So, essentially, we let people feed their families at last year's prices.  "When people do trade down, we make sure they trade down with us. We make it very hard for them to leave us for another retailer."  Looking ahead, it's obviously a challenge to give consumers a good price without compromising your margin and your profitability too much. It's not a big issue for us, but I see many smaller online players struggling with that, especially those that launched during the pandemic.  Q: The pandemic gave rise to a lot of instant delivery propositions. What are your thoughts on that segment?  A: There is very little room for differentiation in that space. Instant is driven by only a handful of SKUs, mostly snacks and drinks. The locations are tiny, and you have to have many of them. And if we offered the wide, differentiated assortment our customers have come to expect from us in those highly dispersed locations, we would end up throwing much of the stock away. Our share of fresh goods is around 45 percent. So instant is not particularly attractive for us.  Q: As you expand to new countries, do you find that your model is universal? Or does it require a lot of adjustment?  A: You need to have a local assortment, but the structure of the assortment is universal. The key is to focus on affluent urban customers. If you do that, the model will work everywhere. In Prague, we deliver to roughly 25 percent of all households. There are no exact numbers, but we can even reach revenues in the magnitude of 50 to 70 percent of Tesco’s offline revenue in Prague.  ---

The image contains a page of text, page number 31, from a publication titled "Living with and responding to uncertainty - State of Grocery Retail 2023: Europe". The text is in the form of a Q&A (Questions and Answers) interview format, discussing the competition between online and brick-and-mortar grocers, strategies for growth in the German market, the challenges and advantages of online grocery platforms, and hiring philosophy. Here are the extracted details:  - Brick-and-mortar grocers have conducted many experiments and discussions in response to the interviewee's success but face challenges in execution at scale. One notable instance was when a big offline player terminated its online trials three times while the interviewee's platform continued to grow, indicating a preference for self-disruption over being disrupted by others.  - Regarding future growth in Germany, the interviewee notes Germans are perceived as price-sensitive but counters that by stating the experience might be different with deeper data analysis. They mention that there is a large demographic of affluent, demanding customers in Germany, and offline players have problems with price sensitivity due to a large number of locations and high fixed costs, whereas the interviewee's company served 30% of all households out of a single fulfillment center in Garching.  - When asked about succeeding as an e-grocery, the interviewee believes it is challenging, stating that consistent execution is essential. Offline grocers transitioning online might struggle with consistency across channels in terms of assortment and prices. They might need to create a separate brand to address this, which could impact profit margins for several years.  - For hiring, the interviewee looks for what they describe as "founder-like quality," mentioning a drive for innovation as a key factor in their success, which is important as they expand into new markets.  This page also includes a highlighted quote: "We look for a founder-like quality in the people we hire. The will to innovate drives our success."  The image is focused on conveying strategic insights regarding the grocery retail market's adaptation to online trends, competitive strategies, and human resource philosophies.

The photograph is a representation of everyday life, particularly for individuals who may be taking precautions such as wearing a mask in public spaces.  At the bottom of the image, there is text that provides contextual information: - © Getty Images (indicating the source of the image) - Page number: 32 - Title: Living with and responding to uncertainty – State of Grocery Retail 2023: Europe  From this textual information, it can be inferred that the image is possibly from a report or publication focusing on the state of grocery retail in Europe for the year 2023, relating to the themes of living with and responding to uncertainty, which could encompass changes in consumer behavior, economic challenges, public health concerns, or other factors affecting the grocery retail sector.

Page Title: Interview  Text Content:  The page features an interview with Luís Araújo, Chief Executive Officer of Biedronka. A quote from him reads, "The core of our value set is our discount mindset. All our decisions are driven by our goal to transfer as much value as possible to our customers."  Photo credit is given to Luís Araújo.  A brief description about Biedronka states that it is the largest retail chain in Poland, with more than 3,000 stores in over 100 towns, and has been present in the Polish market for 27 years.  Interview Questions and Responses:  Q: What are your expectations for the grocery retail industry in 2023? A: Luís Araújo mentions the challenges faced in 2022 including soaring inflation, supply chain disruption, the war in Ukraine, and forecasts that the first half of 2023 will continue to be challenging with high inflation and supply chain issues, negatively impacting consumer confidence and private consumption. However, he predicts a recovery in the second half of 2023 with decreasing inflation and consistent recovery of the supply chain, which will allow for the progressive growth of volumes. There are no signs of recession, but he anticipates increasing competitiveness in their market, with all players aiming for volume and sales growth to offset inflation seen in 2022.  Q: What do you think will be the most important trends in the next three years? A: The CEO identifies digitalization as the most important megatrend, specifically e-commerce, which became more prominent during the pandemic. He discusses Biedronka's late entry into e-commerce and their determination to turn it into a source of differentiation. They aim to implement sustainable methods like using bikes for delivery and exploring urban couriers. Biedronka also considers delivering to delivery boxes, rather than to customers' homes, to reduce consumption and keep routes short, with a strong commitment to e-grocery systems with sustainability in mind.  Q: Do you think digitalization will change the game beyond e-commerce? A: Araújo believes that advances in analytics, artificial intelligence, and automation will significantly improve business efficiency. He suggests a progressive shift in business models as digital initiatives grow.

The image contains two pages from a report or document, with page numbers 34 at the bottom and the title "Living with and responding to uncertainty - State of Grocery Retail 2023: Europe."  The page on the left includes the continuation of an answer to a question asked prior to what's seen on the page. The passage discusses the shift in consumer behavior towards digital media platforms like TikTok and Instagram and how influencers will play an important role in marketing. It emphasizes that understanding consumer trends is essential for aligning with younger customers.  Following that, there is a new question and answer exchange:  Q: You mentioned sustainability as an important trend in its own right. How does this trend affect the way Biedronka does business?  A: The response talks about a growing preference among consumers for healthier and fresher food and more local production and distribution. The company places a focus on the sustainability of the origin of products and their supply chain transparency. A key initiative is to increase local sourcing and generally enhance its sustainability efforts. Biedronka uses sustainability as a criterion when selecting suppliers and gives incentives for reducing carbon footprints with higher sourcing volumes. The company also has a logistics system designed to minimize distances from distribution centers to stores, reduce energy consumption, invest in eco-packaging, lead the market in environmentally friendly solutions, and aims to increase the share of electric vehicles in their fleet.  The page on the right presents another question and answer:  Q: What does it take for a grocer to leverage opportunities within technology and sustainability?  A: The main prerequisite to leveraging opportunities in technology and sustainability is to have the right people. The necessity is highlighted for experienced workers, young talent, and the adoption of the right software and other analytical tools. As the European population ages, the need for talent, knowledge, and skills is also expected to grow.  Further, it is stated that every grocer needs a vision aligned with technological evolution and the continuous evolution of the value proposition. Agility is necessary for retailers to anticipate new opportunities and adapt their practices accordingly.  Another question and answer are presented:  Q: What do you see as the driving forces of Biedronka's continuing success?  A: The respondent identifies the quality of the labor force, especially long-tenured leaders and managers who are fully aligned with the company's vision and customer needs, as the driving force. All decisions are said to strive to transfer as much value as possible to customers. Efficiency, productivity, and cost minimization are considered the backbone of a low-cost system that delivers affordability to the market.  The text offers insights into Biedronka's strategic approaches to sustainability, technology, labor force, and the importance of value delivery in the context of the European grocery retail sector.

The image contains textual information that appears to be from an interview or a question-and-answer segment in a report titled "Living with and responding to uncertainty – State of Grocery Retail 2023: Europe." It is on page 35 of the document.  Here is the extracted text from the image:  Q: In the first three quarters of 2022, your sales grew substantially compared with 2021. What were the predominant drivers of this growth?  A: Before the war in Ukraine, basket size was the most important growth driver. When the war began, traffic became the dominant growth driver. When inflation peaked in the third quarter of 2022, consumption and basket size started to deteriorate. Since then, traffic has been the principal driver of growth.  Q: How much of the volume uptake was driven by customers trading down?  A: Downtrading is only a minor factor. We are gaining market share because consumers appreciate our promise to offer the lowest prices in the market, no matter how difficult the circumstances may be. We have the best price perception in Poland by far. The positive effect of this positioning predates the recent crisis. Even if the competition gets stronger, we are confident that customers will stick with Biedronka. Our commitment to efficiency and productivity enables us to protect consumers from price increases more effectively than the market on average. In the early days of the inflation surge, we even implemented an "anti-inflation shield" with a strong commitment to refrain from increasing the prices of the most frequently bought products in the first half of 2022.  Q: That sounds like quite an investment. What was Biedronka's strategy to address cost pressure in 2022?  A: We accelerated our technological transformation to increase productivity and decrease costs. One example is our investment in renewable energy. We aim to equip more than 2,000 of our stores with solar panels. This is expected to bring energy costs down by about 15 percent, and it will also help to reduce the emission of greenhouse gases.  At the same time, we keep investing in supply chain optimization. Most recently, we opened a new distribution center that helps reduce transportation costs. But the best strategy to deal with cost pressure is to fight for market share gains and volume growth to help dilute costs. This is the core of our strategy, and we will keep doing it.  Highlighted Quote: "The best strategy to deal with cost pressure is to fight for market share gains and volume growth to help dilute costs. This is the core of our strategy, and we will keep doing it."  Analytical Summary: The predominant drivers of sales growth for the company in the first three quarters of 2022 were initially the basket size, followed by traffic with the onset of the war in Ukraine, and eventually traffic alone as basket size and consumption deteriorated due to inflation. Downtrading by customers was minimal as the company focused on offering the lowest prices, thereby gaining market share. The company emphasizes its commitment to efficiency and productivity to shield consumers from price increases, including implementing an "anti-inflation shield". To address cost pressure, Biedronka invested in technology for productivity and cost reduction, including renewable energy initiatives expecting to lower energy costs by 15% and reducing greenhouse gas emissions. A new distribution center was opened to optimize the supply chain and reduce transportation costs. The overarching strategy was to increase market share and volume growth as a means to manage cost pressures.
